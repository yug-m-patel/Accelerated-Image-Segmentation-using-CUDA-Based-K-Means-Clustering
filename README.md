# Accelerated-Image-Segmentation-using-CUDA-Based-K-Means-Clustering
This project implements image segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm, optimized for GPU acceleration through NVIDIA CUDA. The goal is to efficiently segment high-resolution images into distinct color-based regions while significantly reducing computation time compared to CPU-based processing.
